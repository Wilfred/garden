    <div class="container"><h1>An Experiment in Developer Experience</h1>
<p>Garden is a programming language created to explore developer
tooling. It's very slow, very incomplete, but enables some interesting
experiences.</p>
<h2>Incremental Programming</h2>
<p>Very few programming languages allow you to redefine functions and
types whilst your program runs. Smalltalk and Lisp actively encourage
this. A few other languages kinda allow it, if you're willing to
commit lovecraftian horrors and accept the limitations.</p>
<p>Incremental programming is a feature that requires runtime support to
work properly. Typechecking code written incrementally is also
challenging.</p>
<p>It's a wonderful way to write code, and I want more options in this
space. Garden is designed to use incremental programming everywhere.</p>
<h2>Sandboxing</h2>
<p>It's also really hard to add a sandbox to an existing language. Having
a sandbox enables a bunch of interesting experiences.</p>
<p>You can speculatively execute work-in-progress code to see if tests
pass. You can safely do mutation testing, program synthesis,
speculative library installation, or LLM experiments.</p>
<p>Garden has a basic sandbox today, and I hope to add a pledge-style
granular sandbox in future.</p>
<h2>Can I use it?</h2>
<p>Garden is extremely incomplete and slow. Its focus on tooling
means that I added an 'extract function' operation before I added a garbage
collector! Even now, the GC is bad and doesn't handle cycles at all.</p>
<p>Garden is being fully developed in the open, but please set your
expectations low.</p>
<h2>Why 'Garden'?</h2>
<p>If you have a vegetable garden and one vegetable dies because of
frost, you don't raze the whole plot and start over. Programming
should be like this, rather than starting from fresh every time.</p>
<p>If Garden succeeds, it should be a pleasant environment to work in
too.</p></div>
