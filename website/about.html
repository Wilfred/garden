      <h1>About Garden</h1>

      <p>
        Garden exists because I want a language that is interactively editable.
        This is impossible to add to an existing language.
      </p>

      <h2>Taking REPLs Seriously</h2>

      <p>
        Common Lisp and Smalltalk have a superpower: you can modify running
        programs. You can redefine functions and modify class definitions
        without restarting your program.
      </p>

      <p>
        Garden aims to provide that superpower in a conventional language
        design. I'm trying to provide a very familiar syntax and workflow.
      </p>

      <h2>Tooling First</h2>

      <p>
        Garden prioritises developer experience over language functionality. The
        syntax and semantics are deliberately small, so a small team (or just
        me!) can build a delightful, credible language experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Just Enough Typing</h2>

      <p>Types are a nice tool to have too.</p>

      <p>
        Most gradual type systems are intended for incremental adoption in a
        dynamically typed language. Garden is new, but requires a typing model
        that works with code of the form:
      </p>

      <code>
        <pre>
function foo(): String { return ""; }

function bar(): Unit {
    eval("function foo(): Int { return 1; }");
    let x = foo() + 1;
}
      </pre
        >
      </code>

      <h2>Sandboxed Execution</h2>

      <p>
        Garden supports sandbox execution without third-party libraries. This is
        important for two workflows:
      </p>

      <p>
        (1) The IDE can speculatively evaluate snippets of code safely. This is
        convenient and enables 'mutation testing' for code completion.
      </p>

      <p>
        (2) Libraries can declare what capabilities they need, such as network
        or disk. This makes third-party libraries safer to install. This will be
        coarse permissions, similar to OpenBSD's Pledge.
      </p>

      <h2>Tooling Oriented Dynamism</h2>

      <p>
        Garden splits its semantics into (1) simple evaluation that is amenable
        to static analysis, and (2) reflective, dynamic evaluation that is
        friendly to developer experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        This means that errors in userland are plain <code>Result</code> types,
        but unhandled errors can be resumed in a Lisp/Smalltalk manner.
