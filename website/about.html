    <div class="container"><h1>About Garden</h1>

<p>
  Garden exists because I want a language that is interactively editable. This
  is impossible to add to an existing language.
</p>

<h2>Taking REPLs Seriously</h2>

<p>
  Common Lisp and Smalltalk have a superpower: you can modify running programs.
  You can redefine functions and modify class definitions without restarting
  your program.
</p>

<p>
  Garden aims to provide that superpower in a conventional language design. I'm
  trying to provide a very familiar syntax and workflow.
</p>

<h2>Tooling First</h2>

<p>
  Garden prioritises developer experience over language functionality. The
  syntax and semantics are deliberately small, so a small team (or just me!) can
  build a delightful, credible language experience.
</p>

<h2>Just Enough Typing</h2>

<p>Types are a nice tool to have too.</p>

<p>
  Most gradual type systems are intended for incremental adoption in a
  dynamically typed language. Garden is new, but requires a typing model that
  works with code of the form:
</p>

<code>
  <pre>
function foo(): String { return "" }

function bar(): Unit {
    eval("function foo(): Int { return 1 }");
    let x = foo() + 1
}
      </pre
  >
</code>

<h2>Sandboxed Execution</h2>

<p>
  Garden supports sandbox execution without third-party libraries. This is
  important for two workflows:
</p>

<p>
  (1) The IDE can speculatively evaluate snippets of code safely. This is
  convenient and enables 'mutation testing' for code completion.
</p>

<p>
  (2) Libraries can declare what capabilities they need, such as network or
  disk. This makes third-party libraries safer to install. This will be coarse
  permissions, similar to OpenBSD's Pledge.
</p>

<h2>Tooling Oriented Dynamism</h2>

<p>
  Garden splits its semantics into (1) simple evaluation that is amenable to
  static analysis, and (2) reflective, dynamic evaluation that is friendly to
  developer experience.
</p>

<p>
  This means that errors in userland are plain <code>Result</code> types, but
  unhandled errors can be resumed in a Lisp/Smalltalk manner.
