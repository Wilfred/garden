# Choosing a Syntax

After deciding the primary design goals of Garden, what syntax should
it have?

## Considering Lisp

Many live programming environments use a parenthesis-oriented Lisp
syntax. After some soul-searching -- I have fond feelings towards many
Lisp dialects -- I decided on a more conventional syntax.

### Against Homogeneous Syntax

Let nesting.

Too much nesting.

Similar things in appearance, not semantics.

### Macros Need Parens

### Live Programming Does Not

## Spending The Weirdness Budget
