    <div class="container"><h1>Choosing a Syntax</h1>
<p>To kick things off, I want to talk about the basic syntax of
Garden. Garden has a deliberately conventional syntax.</p>
<pre><code><a class="keyword" href="./keyword:fun.html">fun</a> fib(i: <a class="type" href="./type:Int.html">Int</a>): <a class="type" href="./type:Int.html">Int</a> {
  <a class="keyword" href="./keyword:if.html">if</a> i &lt; 2 {
    <a class="keyword" href="./keyword:return.html">return</a> 1
  }

  fib(i - 1) + fib(i - 2)
}</code></pre>
<p>I'm trying to avoid spending my <a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/the-language-strangeness-budget/">strangeness
budget</a>
on syntax.</p>
<h2>Keywords</h2>
<p>I want keywords to be short. This follows <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/stroustrups-rule/">Stroustrup's
Rule</a>,
which favours short syntax for common operations. There's little
benefit for <code>function</code> in JavaScript, it's just more typing on the
keyboard.</p>
<p>However, I want keywords to be pronouncable, hence <code>fun</code> instead of
<code>fn</code>. This is based on the Strange Loop talk <a href="https://youtu.be/g1ib43q3uXQ?t=2165">How to teach programming
(and other things)?</a> by Felienne
Hermans (creator of <a href="https://hedy.org/">Hedy</a>). Felienne talks about
the advantages of reading code aloud when teaching, and I want to
support that. I say code aloud sometimes too, especially in
conversations.</p>
<h2>Lisp and Nesting</h2>
<p>Lisp is a big influence on Garden, and I enjoy using s-expression
syntax. Unfortunately it's outside my strangeness budget. I also think
the uniformity can make some code patterns harder to read, because
code with vastly different semantics can appear quite similar visually.</p>
<p>Parentheses-focused syntax has some interesting advantages though.</p>
<p>(1) S-expressions make macro systems easier. You have a natural
correspondence between surface syntax and the data structures that
macros see. Macros aren't a priority in Garden as they make developer
tooling harder, and tooling is my primary focus.</p>
<p>(2) An expression-oriented language with a simple nested syntax makes
it really easy to evaluate snippets. You can evaluate both definitions
and expressions in the interactive interpreter ("REPL").</p>
<p>You often see subexpressions that you can evaluate in
isolation too!</p>
<pre><code>(defun garden-send-input (string &optional path offset end-offset)
  "Send STRING to the current garden session for evaluation."
  (let ((buf (garden--active-buffer)))
    (garden--send-run (get-buffer-process buf) string path offset end-offset)))</code></pre>
<p>I can run <code>(garden--active-buffer)</code> on its own, which is super
convenient. Unfortunately I can't do this for all expressions. There's
no easy way to see the output of <code>(get-buffer-process buf)</code> without
e.g. setting a breakpoint, because <code>buf</code> is bound outside the function
call.</p>
<p>I plan to support this 'evaluate this subexpression' feature in
Garden's syntax.</p>
<h2>Smalltalk</h2>
<p>Smalltalk is another big influence on Garden. The Smalltalk syntax is
small, but it's not widely known. It would be costly to my strangeness
budget.</p>
<p>Smalltalk syntax also has a few interesting advantages.</p>
<p>(1) Block syntax works like a closure, but it doesn't support early
return. Instead, <code>^</code> is early return anywhere inside a method
definition, even inside blocks.</p>
<p><code>^</code> and blocks are an elegant way to express control flow primitives.
However, if we're doing conventional loops anyway, there's not much benefit
to Garden.</p>
<p>(2) Method arguments are almost always keyword arguments, and often
resemble sentences. This is often very readable.</p>
<pre><code>10 to: 1 by: -1 do: [:x | x printNl ]</code></pre>
<p>It's also explicit that the keywords are part of the API. I've worked
with languages (particularly Python) where you rename a parameter and
accidentally break your call sites, because they're using keyword
rather than positional arguments.</p>
<p>Garden currently uses positional arguments, as it was conventional and
simpler to implement. It's also less verbose, especially when
experimenting in the REPL.</p>
<h2>Unconventional Bits</h2>
<p>I'm happy to break convention where it makes sense for Garden's
design. For example, methods are not defined inside the method type.</p>
<pre><code><a class="keyword" href="./keyword:struct.html">struct</a> <span class="type">Person</span> {
  name: <a class="type" href="./type:String.html">String</a>,
}

<a class="keyword" href="./keyword:method.html">method</a> greet(this: <span class="type">Person</span>): <a class="type" href="./type:String.html">String</a> {
  <span class="string">"Hello " </span>^ this.name ^ <span class="string">"!"</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>This aligns with Garden's goals of allowing incremental program
definition. You don't want to re-evaluate the whole type definition
when you're just changing a single method.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Every example in the docs is type checked, so you can always read this
website to see the exact syntax supported.</p>
<p>I'm relatively happy with the overall syntax, but the real test will
be in the tooling I can build around it.</p></div>
