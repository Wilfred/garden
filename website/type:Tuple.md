<!-- Tuple is a type defined internally and doesn't have a stub,
because it has a variable number of type arguments.

# `Tuple` type

A tuple is a fixed-size collection where each item can have a distinct
type. For example, `(123, "foo")`.

```title:example
fun example(): (Int, String) {
  (456, "bar")
}
```
