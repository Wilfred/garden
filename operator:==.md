# `==` and `!=` Operators

`==` compares two values, and returns `True` if they are equal.

```
1 + 1 == 2 //-> True
1 == 2 //-> False
```

Compound values are compared by their elements.

```
[1, 2] == [1, 1 + 1] //-> True
```

`!=` compares whether two values are not equal.

```
1 != 2 //-> True
```
