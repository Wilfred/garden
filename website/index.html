    <div class="container"><h1>üè° The Garden Programming Language</h1>
<p>Garden is an experimental programming language focused on interactive
tooling.</p>
<h2>Taking REPLs Seriously</h2>
<p>Common Lisp and Smalltalk have a superpower: you can modify running
programs. You can redefine functions and modify class definitions
without restarting your program.</p>
<p>Garden aims to provide that superpower in a conventional language
design.</p>
<h2>Tooling First</h2>
<p>Garden prioritises developer experience over language
functionality. The syntax and semantics are deliberately small, so a
small team (or just me!) can build a delightful, credible language
experience.</p>
<h2>Just Enough Typing</h2>
<p>Most gradual type systems are intended for incremental adoption in a
dynamically typed language. Garden is new, but requires a typing model that
works with code of the form:</p>
<pre><code>function foo(): String { return "" }

function bar(): Unit {
    eval("function foo(): Int { return 1 }");
    let x = foo() + 1
}</code></pre>
<h2>Sandboxed Execution</h2>
<p>Garden supports sandbox execution without third-party libraries. This
is important for two workflows:</p>
<p>(1) The IDE can speculatively evaluate snippets of code safely. This
is convenient and enables 'mutation testing' for code completion.</p>
<p>(2) Libraries can declare what capabilities they need, such as network
or disk. This makes third-party libraries safer to install. This will
be coarse permissions, similar to OpenBSD's Pledge.</p>
<h2>Tooling Oriented Dynamism</h2>
<p>Garden splits its semantics into (1) simple evaluation that is
amenable to static analysis, and (2) reflective, dynamic evaluation
that is friendly to developer experience.</p>
<p>This means that errors in userland are plain <code>Result</code> types, but
unhandled errors can be fixed at runtime by a programmer.</p></div>
