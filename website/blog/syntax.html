<h1>Choosing a Syntax</h1>
<p>To kick things off, I want to talk about the basic syntax of Garden.</p>
<pre><code><a href="./keyword:fun.html"><span class="keyword">fun</span></a> fib(i: <a href="./type:Int.html"><span class="type">Int</span></a>): <a href="./type:Int.html"><span class="type">Int</span></a> {
  <a href="./keyword:if.html"><span class="keyword">if</span></a> i &lt; 2 {
    <a href="./keyword:return.html"><span class="keyword">return</span></a> 1
  }</p>
<p>  fib(i - 1) + fib(i - 2)
}</code></pre>
<p>I'm trying to avoid spending my <a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/the-language-strangeness-budget/">strangeness
budget</a>
on syntax. Garden has a deliberately conventional syntax.</p>
<h2>Keywords</h2>
<p>I want to keep Garden keywords short. This follows <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/stroustrups-rule/">Stroustrup's
Rule</a>,
which favours short syntax for common operations. There's little
benefit for <code>function</code> in JavaScript, it's just more typing on the
keyboard.</p>
<p>However, I want keywords to be pronouncable, hence <code>fun</code> instead of
<code>fn</code>. This is based on the Strange Loop talk [How to teach programming (and other things)?](https://youtu.be/g1ib43q3uXQ?t=2165)
by Felienne Hermans (creator of Hedy). Felienne talks about the
advantages of reading code aloud when teaching, and I want to support
that. I say code aloud when discussing with other programmers too.</p>
<h2>Lisp and Nesting</h2>
<p>Lisp is a big influence on Garden, and I enjoy using s-expression
syntax. Unfortunately it's outside my strangeness budget. I also think
the uniformity can make some code patterns harder to read, because
code with vastly different semantics can appear quite similar.</p>
<p>Parentheses-focused syntax has some interesting advantages though.</p>
<p>(1) S-expressions make macro systems easier. You have a natural
correspondence between surface syntax and the data structures that
macros see. Macros aren't a priority in Garden as they make developer
tooling harder, and tooling is my primary focus.</p>
<p>(2) An expression-oriented language with a simple nested syntax makes
it really easy to evaluate snippets. You can evaluate both definitions
and expressions in the interactive interpreter ("REPL").</p>
<p>You often see subexpressions that you can evaluate in
isolation too!</p>
<pre><code>(defun garden-send-input (string &optional path offset end-offset)
  "Send STRING to the current garden session for evaluation."
  (let ((buf (garden--active-buffer)))
    (garden--send-run (get-buffer-process buf) string path offset end-offset)))</code></pre>
<p>I can run <code>(garden--active-buffer)</code> on its own, which is super
convenient. Unfortunately I can't do this for all expressions, there's
no easy way to see the output of <code>(get-buffer-process buf)</code> without
e.g. setting a breakpoint.</p>
<p>I plan to support this 'evaluate this subexpression' feature in
Garden's syntax.</p>
<h2>Smalltalk</h2>
<p>Smalltalk is another big influence on Garden. The Smalltalk syntax is
small, but it's not widely known. It would be costly to my strangeness
budget.</p>
<p>Smalltalk syntax also has a few interesting advantages.</p>
<p>(1) Block syntax works like a closure, but it doesn't support early
return. Instead, <code>^</code> is early return anywhere inside a method
definition, even inside blocks.</p>
<p><code>^</code> and blocks are an elegant way to express control flow primitives,
but if we're doing conventional loops anyway, there's not much benefit
to Garden.</p>
<p>(2) Method arguments are almost always keyword arguments, and often
resemble sentences. This is often very readable.</p>
<pre><code>10 to: 1 by: -1 do: <a href="/code></pre>
<p>It's also explicit that the keywords are part of the API. I've worked
with languages (particularly Python">:x | x printNl </a> where you rename a parameter and
accidentally break your call sites, because they're using keyword
rather than positional arguments.</p></div>
